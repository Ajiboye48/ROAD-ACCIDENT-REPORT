# ROAD ACCIDENT PROJECT REPORT

**Project Overview / Objective:**
This project aims to analyze road traffic accidents across Nigeria from 2021 to 2023 to uncover patterns, identify high-risk regions, understand contributing factors, and provide actionable insights for policymakers, road safety agencies, and the public. The ultimate goal is to support data-driven interventions to reduce accidents and fatalities on Nigerian roads.

**Scope:**
* **Geographical coverage:** All 36 states in Nigeria, including the FCT
* **Timeframe**: January 2021 to December 2023
* **Variables analyzed**: Number of accidents, fatal cases, Serious cases, Minor cases, Highest casualty, Highest number of people injured, and Highest number of people involved on state-wise distribution.

**Methodology:**
* Data Collection: Gathered structured data on reported road accidents from official and verified sources
* Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized column formats (e.g., dates, state names)
* Data Transformation: Created new metrics (e.g., fatality rate per 100 accidents), and categorized causes.
* Visual Analysis: Built interactive visuals to uncover temporal and regional trends

**Data Source:**
* Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Nigeria official reports
* Supplemented with open government data portals and verified datasets from Kaggle and data repositories when available
* Cross-checked for consistency with media and annual transport statistics publications

**Tools Used:**
**Microsoft Excel:**
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
Raw data was first imported into Excel for initial cleaning. Tasks included removing duplicates, correcting inconsistent spellings (e.g., state names), filling or flagging missing values, and standardizing date formats.
2. **Pivot Tables & Charts**:
Used extensively to summarize accident counts by year and state. Pivot Tables made it easy to generate quick insights into totals, averages, and trends.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
**Key observations from EDA include:**
A noticeable spike in road accidents in Q4 of each year
Kaduna, FCT, and Ogun consistently reported the highest number of accidents
Speed violation and loss of control were among the top causes
Commercial vehicles were involved in over 60% of all reported incidents
Higher accident rates were recorded during festive periods and weekends
