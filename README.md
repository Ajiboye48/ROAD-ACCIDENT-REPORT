# ROAD ACCIDENT PROJECT REPORT

**Project Overview / Objective:**
This project aims to analyze road traffic accidents across Nigeria from 2021 to 2023 to uncover patterns, identify high-risk regions, understand contributing factors, and provide actionable insights for policymakers, road safety agencies, and the public. The ultimate goal is to support data-driven interventions to reduce accidents and fatalities on Nigerian roads.

**Scope:**
* Geographical coverage: All 36 states in Nigeria, including the FCT
* Timeframe: January 2021 to December 2023
* Variables analyzed: Number of accidents, fatal cases, Serious cases, Minor cases, Highest casualty, Highest number of people injured, and Highest number of people involved on state-wise distribution.

**Methodology:**
* Data Collection: Gathered structured data on reported road accidents from official and verified sources
* Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized column formats (e.g., dates, state names)
* Data Transformation: Created new metrics (e.g., fatality rate per 100 accidents), and categorized causes.
* Visual Analysis: Built interactive visuals to uncover temporal and regional trends

**Data Source:**
* Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Nigeria official reports
* Supplemented with open government data portals and verified datasets from Kaggle and data repositories when available
* Cross-checked for consistency with media and annual transport statistics publications
