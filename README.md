# ROAD ACCIDENT PROJECT REPORT

## **Project Overview / Objective:**
This project aims to analyze road traffic accidents across Nigeria from 2021 to 2023 to uncover patterns, identify high-risk regions, understand contributing factors, and provide actionable insights for policymakers, road safety agencies, and the public. The ultimate goal is to support data-driven interventions to reduce accidents and fatalities on Nigerian roads.

### **Scope:**
* **Geographical coverage:** All 36 states in Nigeria, including the FCT
* **Timeframe**: January 2021 to December 2023
* **Variables analyzed**: Number of accidents, fatal cases, Serious cases, Minor cases, Highest casualty, Highest number of people injured, and Highest number of people involved on state-wise distribution.

### **Methodology:**
* Data Collection: Gathered structured data on reported road accidents from official and verified sources
* Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized column formats (e.g., dates, state names)
* Data Transformation: Created new metrics (e.g., fatality rate per 100 accidents), and categorized causes.
* Visual Analysis: Built interactive visuals to uncover temporal and regional trends

### **Data Source:**
* Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Nigeria official reports
* Supplemented with open government data portals and verified datasets from Kaggle and data repositories when available
* Cross-checked for consistency with media and annual transport statistics publications

### **Tools Used:**
**Microsoft Excel:**
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
  Raw data was first imported into Excel for initial cleaning. Tasks included removing duplicates, correcting inconsistent spellings (e.g., state names), filling or flagging missing values, and standardizing date formats.
2. **Pivot Tables & Charts**:
  Used extensively to summarize accident counts by year and state. Pivot Tables made it easy to generate quick insights into totals, averages, and trends.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
**Key observations from EDA include:**
1. A noticeable spike in road accidents in Q4 of each year
2. Kaduna, FCT, and Ogun consistently reported the highest number of accidents
3. Speed violation and loss of control were among the top causes
4. Commercial vehicles were involved in over 60% of all reported incidents
5. Higher accident rates were recorded during festive periods and weekends

 __Formulas & Functions:__
Functions like IF, VLOOKUP, TEXT, and SUMIFS helped in data transformation, creating new calculated columns such as:
* Monthly accident rates
* Fatality-per-accident ratios
* Classification of accident severity

### **Results**:
1. Identified top 10 high-risk states with recurring accident trends
2. Established a link between vehicle type and accident severity
3. Quantified the reduction (or increase) in fatalities over the three-year period
4. Demonstrated temporal patterns that align with major travel periods and road usage surges

### **Top 10 States with Fatal Cases**
This chart highlights the states with the highest number of deadly road traffic accidents, emphasizing areas where accidents most often result in loss of life.
* **Observation**: States like FCT, Kaduna, and Ogun appear consistently, likely due to higher population density, busy road networks, and increased vehicular movement.
* **Implication**: These states may require targeted road safety enforcement and emergency response upgrades to mitigate fatalities.

### **Top 10 States with Minor Cases**
This visualization shows states where road traffic accidents most frequently resulted in minor injuries or low-severity incidents.
* **Observation**: Urban centers such as Lagos, FCT and Ogun had high counts of minor incidents, possibly due to better emergency responses or slower traffic speeds in congested zones.
* **Implication**: While less severe, frequent minor accidents could signal broader issues in road usage behavior or poor traffic discipline.

### **Top 10 States with the Highest Number of Casualties**
This chart aggregates both fatalities and injuries to measure the total human cost per state.
* **Observation**: States with high vehicle density and poor road conditions top the chart, indicating that sheer accident volume and intensity contribute to casualty rates.
* **Implication**: Comprehensive safety strategies are needed in these regions—focusing on both accident prevention and post-accident care.

### **Top 10 States with Serious Cases**
Here, the dashboard isolates accidents classified as serious, where injuries were significant but not fatal.
* **Observation**: States like FCT, Del, and Rivers show disproportionately high serious cases, suggesting infrastructure issues (e.g., potholes, poor signage) or high-speed road segments.
* **Implication**: These states may benefit from road audits, speed regulation, and driver safety training.

### **Top 10 States with Highest Number of People Involved**
This metric reflects the scale and reach of road traffic accidents, showing where the largest number of individuals were impacted regardless of injury or fatality.
* **Observation**: Major transit hubs and interstate corridor states dominate this list, with figures suggesting involvement in multi-vehicle crashes or densely populated transport areas.
* **Implication**: High-involvement regions should be prioritized for intelligent traffic systems, monitoring, and driver compliance enforcement.

### **Top 10 States with Highest Number of Injured People**
This focuses solely on non-fatal injuries, pointing out where most road users sustained physical harm.
* **Observation**: Overlaps exist with the serious cases chart, but also unique entries where many walkways or public transport users are affected.
* **Implication**: These insights emphasize the need for pedestrian safety measures, medical response training, and review of transport vehicle safety standards.

### **Recommendations**:
1. Intensify public road safety awareness campaigns, especially in high-risk states
2. Enforce stricter speed limit regulations and increase presence of road patrols
3. Improve road infrastructure in accident-prone regions
4. Promote the use of intelligent transport systems (ITS) for better traffic monitoring
5. Encourage annual safety audits and public release of traffic data for transparency and policy formulation

### **Data Story: Road Traffic Accidents in Nigeria (2021–2023)**
Understanding the Human and Regional Impact Through Dashboard Insights
To uncover deeper insights into the nature and impact of road traffic accidents across Nigeria, this dashboard focuses on six key indicators across all 36 states and the FCT. Each visualization reveals distinct patterns that, together, tell a comprehensive story of road safety challenges in Nigeria between 2021 and 2023
